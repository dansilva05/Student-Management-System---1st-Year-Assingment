This repository contains my first Java assignment for the module **Programming Fundamentals 1**.

It is a simple **Student Management System** built as a beginner project. The system can store a limited number of students and supports basic CRUD operations:
- **Create** students  
- **Read** (view) students  
- **Update** student information  
- **Delete** students  

Each Student can have Grades and Comments added to them.
